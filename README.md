# ToDo:
Abstract, agnostic & product- centric KISS framework for Agile Development (& ALM) 

 # What I want?

I need some central project-management framework (starting with *template* as in "categories-notes") to keep me organised as self-employed one-man-show freelance developer. Want it simple but expandable, structured and providing me with single source of truth about all my activities. Want to track issues, end-user communication etc., in the ideal case it will be as much automated as possible. Why not CI/CD etc. Ideally: complete ALM app.

# Main Value of potential sowtware (app):

To make my life easier, to serve me as the backbone of my activity. Tailored for me initially, it should become open for more players (employees, subcontractors...other roles)

# KISS

Basic functionality, no time for big systems

# GTD Approach
In this iteration, we just want it running ASAP; 

# Epic (1) -- create template (folder structure) around abstract (any) web-app project.

This is a good way to organise the *way* of organising development, from developer point of view. Take the template and start from there. The first iteration is this "todo" project and making the categoryes (folder) with relations and descriotions (readme files) as a basic "iformal" ontology.

Note that this is not the source tree, no real code lives in these folders. We just decribe and organise the product here. In each respective folder/subfolder we have human readable files with notes about the respective module and later -- links to the repositories of the given module/part.

We think in categories, relations, requirements, integration, rules, principles here, not development tasks. We create a model here. Any potential code living in this repo is for supporting the modeling work, not about the target product code itself.
