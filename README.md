# ToDo:
Abstract, agnostic & product- centric KISS tool for Agile ALM 

 # What I want?

I need some central project-management to keep me organised as self-employed one-man-show freelance developer. Want it simple but expandable, structured and providing me with single source of truth about all my activities. Want to track issues, end-user communication etc., in the ideal case it will be as much automated as possible. Why not CI/CD etc.

# Main Goal

To make my life easier, to serve me as the backbone of my activity. Tailored for me initially, it should become open for more players (employees, subcontractors...other roles)

# KISS

Basic functionality, no time for waterfall projects

# GTD Approach
In this iteration, we just want it running ASAP;
