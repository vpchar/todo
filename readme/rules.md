# Design paradigm for the tool itself:

- Agile: Go Live ASAP, Stay alive on every iteration, forever live no matter what
- Plug & Play Isolation (microservices, api-style)
- Product security & scalability (deployed)
- Publisher -> Product -> Project -> Code
- Again: GTD, TLDR, KISS, noBS ...
- CI/CD
- Tree of Life (monolith repo)
- self documenting - noBS readme in each folder
- modular means SMALL modules
- procedure development on each step
- non mission critical
- not planned for big/huge projects/vendors
- core isolation (backend), plug-n-play frontend

# Master plan:

 (1) KISS (minimalistic, no-BS ) 

 (2) Abstract (see.1)

 (3) Agnostic (tools, services, languages...)

 (4) Product-centric DEVELOPMENT of LIVE software
